				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>By David Abel</strong></h6>
<h6><strong>April 24, 2018</strong></h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three Democrats vying for the state’s top office blamed Governor Charlie Baker Monday for failing to take more aggressive action to combat climate change, promote public transportation, and protect the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Suffolk University forum organized by environmental groups, gubernatorial candidates Jay Gonzalez, former governor Deval Patrick’s budget administration chief; Robert K. Massie, an environmental activist and entrepreneur; and Setti Warren, the former Newton mayor — largely offered similar views on a range of energy and environmental issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But each criticized Baker for his environmental record, saying he had not made the issue a priority or done enough to resist the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need to be aiming a lot higher,” said Gonzalez, who took issue with the notion that Baker is too popular to beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to be popular when you don’t do anything, and you never take a stand, and your whole approach to the job is being cautious instead of courageous,” he said. “Elections are about choices, and in this case, this is going to be a choice between a governor who has made no progress on any issue that affects people’s lives in real ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren joined the other candidates in pledging to devote at least 1 percent of the state’s budget to environmental issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe deeply that we need change and new direction at the state level,” he said. “I will be your champion on Beacon Hill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren noted that he was the only candidate with experience as a chief executive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been spending a lot of time together,” Warren noted. “These guys are terrific … But we now need a fresh perspective. We need change on Beacon Hill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forum was sponsored by the Environmental League of Massachusetts and nine other environmental groups. Baker was invited to attend but said he was unavailable, forum organizers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker has raised nearly $8 million for his campaign, while the three Democrats collectively have less than $200,000 in cash on hand. But Massie told the crowd not to worry, noting that Democrats have won in special elections from New Jersey to Virginia over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a Democrat can win in Alabama, a Democrat can win in Massachusetts,” said Massie, who has founded environmental groups including the Global Reporting Initiative and the Investor Network on Climate Risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats will hold their political convention in June, when each of the candidates has to secure at least 15 percent support from party delegates to appear on the ballot for the September primary. The general election is in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billy Pitman, a spokesman for Baker, defended the governor’s record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[The governor is] proud of his administration’s record on nation-leading energy, environmental, and climate change resiliency reforms including the largest procurement of clean energy in Massachusetts’ history, legislation to promote energy efficiency transparency for home buyers, and measures that will help the Commonwealth meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and remain the most energy-efficient state in the nation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic candidates, meanwhile, addressed a range of topics, from what they would do to promote renewable energy to how they would comply with a state law mandating reductions in greenhouse gases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a question about how to maintain a reliable power supply without promoting fossil fuels, Warren, an Iraq War veteran who worked in the Clinton White House, said he would push the state to build more offshore wind power and solar energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzalez said he supports similar proposals, saying he would finance them by raising taxes on millionaires and imposing a tax on companies that produce carbon dioxide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also took aim at Baker for not doing more to address climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a governor only talking about this now,” as the election approaches, he said. “There’s no sense of urgency. If I am governor, you can count on that I will make [climate change] urgent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massie suggested that the state should seriously consider building a barrier in Boston Harbor to protect the city from rising sea levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government studies suggest sea levels could climb as much as 10 feet by the end of the century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re gong to have to consider retreating” from some areas, such as parts of East Boston and the waterfront in South Boston, which will become increasingly prone to flooding in the coming decades, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On improving public transportation, Gonzalez, who also served as chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Early Education and Care, said it would be a top priority of his administration and blamed Baker for “dragging us backwards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a governor who is reducing investments in transportation,” he said. “That’s the exact opposite of what we should be doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some of those attending, it was their first opportunity to learn about the candidates. Allan Fierce, 71, a retired state employee from Stow, said he plans to support Gonzalez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was leaning toward Bob,” he said, but he felt Massie had more of a “gauzy view” of the issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jay demonstrated a detailed understanding of how to move forward on any number of environmental issues, in a way that’s practical and doable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia Bell, 20, a political science student at University of Massachusetts Boston, however, said she planned to vote for Massie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He keyed into the room really well,” she said. “I felt like he was a motivator.”</span></p>

<h6>April 19, 2018</h6>
<p>A top Democratic Party official Thursday criticized Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s response to the latest allegations involving financial irregularities within the Massachusetts State Police and called for an independent investigation of the department.</p>
<p>State police have been buffeted by a series of recent disclosures including an audit that pointed to overtime abuse by troopers patrolling the Massachusetts Turnpike. On Wednesday a prosecutor announced that a payroll director, Denise Ezekiel, had been charged with larceny for allegedly stealing more than $23,000 from the agency.</p>
<p>“When senior command staff at the scandal-ridden State Police are given a way out through retirement in the wake of serious allegations and the Governor turns around and says it’s a ‘good thing’ when charges are brought against a middle manager in the payroll department, it’s time for an independent investigation,” said Gus Bickford, the state’s Democratic party chairman, in a statement.</p>
<p>Bickford’s reference was to remarks Baker made to several reporters on Wednesday. The governor did not characterize the charges against Ezekiel as being a positive development, but credited state police for uncovering and investigating the alleged theft.</p>
<p>“This is good news, folks,” said Baker, according to Masslive.com. “When the leadership of the state police is cleaning up its own house and doing the investigation that develops a baseline for criminal investigation, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.”</p>
<p>Ezekiel is scheduled for arraignment on Monday. Her lawyer did not immediately return a message.</p>
<p>Bickford did not elaborate on his call for an independent probe. A Democratic Party spokeswoman said he preferred something along the lines of what the House Ways and Means Committee proposed last week as part of its state budget plan. The panel called for a multifaceted approach, including a review by a special legislative commission of state police promotion and hiring practices; a new internal audit unit directed by the state’s inspector general; and an examination of the department’s overall management structure by experts at University of Massachusetts-Boston.</p>
<p>Former Newton Mayor Setti Warren, a Democratic candidate for governor, called on the Legislature to form an independent commission and suggested Baker had “lost the necessary perspective” to supervise the state police.</p>
<p>Baker recently ordered the unit that currently patrols the turnpike be disbanded. He also called for troopers to wear body cameras and that GPS be used to track the whereabouts of state police vehicles.</p>
<p>“Stuff that goes on (during) my watch belongs to me,” Baker acknowledged Thursday when asked during an appearance on WGBH-FM if he should have been more aware of issues surrounding the department before they came to light publicly.</p>
<p>While he could never know “everything about everything,” in state government, “once issues are raised we will do everything to fix them and address them,” said Baker, who is running for a second four-year term.</p>

<h6>April 19, 2018</h6>
<p>A day after news broke of an allegation against the payroll director for the State Police, the chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party called for an independent investigation into the law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>Denise Ezekiel, the director of payroll, has been on unpaid leave since November, a fact uncovered by MassLive after a list of State Police suspensions was obtained through a public records request. Charges against her were announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gus Bickford, the Mass. Democratic Party chairman, pointed to a series of scandals inside the State Police and took aim at Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican running for re-election this year.</p>
<p>One of three Democrats jockeying to take on Baker this fall, former Newton Mayor Setti Warren, has also called for an independent investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;When senior command staff at the scandal-ridden State Police are given a way out through retirement in the wake of serious allegations and the Governor turns around and says it&#8217;s a &#8216;good thing&#8217; when charges are brought against a middle manager in the payroll department, it&#8217;s time for an independent investigation,&#8221; Bickford said in a statement.</p>
<p>After MassLive on Wednesday reported on Ezekiel&#8217;s unpaid leave, Baker told reporters that the allegation is a sign the agency is seeking fixes after the series of scandals.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the leadership of the State Police is cleaning up its own house and doing the investigation that develops a baseline for criminal investigation, that&#8217;s a good thing, not a bad thing,&#8221; Baker said.</p>
<p>The top Democrats in the Massachusetts House and state Senate, who closely work with Baker, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Bickford&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>Baker, along with new State Police Col. Kerry Gilpin, proposed a number of reforms earlier this month, including the elimination of Troop E, after the troubled law enforcement agency has seen alleged overtime abuses and exhibited a deep-seated lack of transparency. Some of the proposed reforms have to go through the State Police union.</p>
<p>At the press conference announcing the reforms, Baker said if it were up to him, he would take away the accused troopers&#8217; pensions. The state retirement board has authority over pension benefits, though it is limited in taking action on revoking a pension until after a criminal conviction tied to the public employee&#8217;s job.</p>
<p>Warren, the Baker challenger and former Newton mayor, noted that Ezekiel has been charged by the Middlesex District Attorney&#8217;s office after a &#8220;secret&#8221; investigation that lasted six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the first story broke last November about how the State Police handled the arrest of a judge&#8217;s daughter I called for an independent and impartial investigation. Charlie Baker refused,&#8221; Warren said in a statement. &#8220;Now it turns out at the same time that Gov. Baker was swearing up and down that the problems in that agency were limited to a few bad apples, another investigation of more corruption was already starting.&#8221;</p>

<h6>April 15, 2018</h6>
<p>The three Democratic candidates for governor, all living in the Boston area, presented many similar “progressive” priorities that sat well with a receptive audience at a recent Coalition for Social Justice forum at Bristol Community College.</p>
<p>The differences were sharp, however, in terms of experience in government and how Bob Massie, Setti Warren and Jay Gonzalez might govern, while naturally agreeing the Republican administration of Gov. Charlie Baker was not doing its job fighting for the majority of citizens.</p>
<p>“The defining issue of our time is economic inequality,” said Warren, 47, of Newton.</p>
<p>The former eight-year mayor of his hometown, an Iraq veteran with a law degree, Warren in his opening statement said that all three agree on many issues in contrast with Baker.</p>
<p>Those shared priorities include things like $15 an hour minimum wages and single-payer health care and building the full route for South Coast Rail even though it will cost more and take more time.</p>
<p>He said their national message inspired a movement against gun control that needs to be expanded to other issues, which he referenced during the two-hour CSJ forum.</p>
<p>“If I’m your governor, I will fight for a living wage, paid family leave, affordable housing and debt-free college,” said Gonzalez, 47, of Needham.</p>
<p>He said their national message inspired a movement against gun control that needs to be expanded to other issues, which he referenced during the two-hour CSJ forum.</p>
<p>“If I’m your governor, I will fight for a living wage, paid family leave, affordable housing and debt-free college,” said Gonzalez, 47, of Needham.</p>

Three Democratic candidates for governor speak their minds<br />
A former health insurance CEO and secretary of administration and finance under the prior Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick, he said bringing single-payer health care would make quality care affordable for all.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said President Donald Trump “is taking us backwards,” while calling Baker “a status quo, wait-and-see governor” with a poor record fighting discrimination.</p>
<p>“Charlie Baker has set us up for a fiscal crisis,” Gonzalez said. He claimed “rainy-day funds” are low and called the state’s finances “the scandal nobody is talking about.”</p>
<p>Massachusetts will be one of 36 states electing its governor in November.</p>
<p>While all three Democrats trail the popular Baker by huge margins, Gonzalez was undaunted: “We’re going to win this election,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m a movement guy like you,” Massie, 61, of Somerville, told the BCC audience of approximately 100 people. He and his wife are both union members as an author and a college instructor, respectively.</p>
<p>Massie said he didn’t obtain his doctorate from Harvard Business School to earn more money.</p>
<p>It was to be “a more powerful advocate” for “economic, racial and social justice,” said Massie, who “formed coalitions” for change including global energy improvements.</p>
<p>“What we have here is economic power subverting democratic government,” Massie said.</p>
<p>The renowned environmentalist and businessman said whether change requires inspiring people, pushing them or law changes, “I know how to do that.”</p>
<p>He also brought the most compelling background of overcoming personal hurdles.</p>
<p>“Are any of you nurses?” Massie asked when an audience question focused on the candidates’ support for the “Safe Patient Limits” ballot initiative in November. (All three favor passage.)</p>
<p>Born with genetic disorders that included bleeding from his joints, Massie said, “I couldn’t walk by age 4.” He was in a wheelchair and later required a liver transplant.”</p>
<p>Eight years later they moved to France, and he received extraordinary medical care.</p>
<p>While he uses a cane, he proudly said, “everything’s been cured.</p>
<p>“I know a lot of nurses,” he said on key ballot point of setting “safe patient limits” for medical treatment. “We need to make sure this passes.”</p>
<p>Massie said he’d be “a voracious advocate” for people with disabilities and “an inclusive governor.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he was the only candidate in the race with who’d worked in health care in the private and public sectors. “I know the industry.”</p>
<p>“The most important way we measure ourselves is how we treat the most vulnerable,” Gonzalez said of children, the elderly and those who are disabled.</p>
<p>Warren concentrated comments on the opiate crisis and state deficiencies in transportation and public education.</p>
<p>On the issue of supporting the Legislature’s recently released criminal justice reform bill, Warren told why, unlike the other two candidates, he’d oppose and veto it as governor.</p>
<p>He cited new mandates in the bill for “nonviolent drug offenders.”</p>
<p>He said mandatory minimum sentences included in this bill “are discriminatory” and they “don’t reduce crime.”</p>
<p>“Do I believe we should put in place new discriminatory practices? No,” Warren said.</p>
<p>Massie said he’d sign it as a step toward combating “institutional racism and fundamental inequality.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he opposes all mandatory minimum sentences except for murder. He called criminal justice reform “the single biggest rights issue of our time.”</p>
<p>While this bill “is not perfect,” he’d sign it.</p>
<p>The CSJ supports the bill.</p>
<p>Prior to this forum, the candidates filled out lengthy questionnaires on a dozen issues that included revenue, jobs/workers’ rights, immigration, the environment and transportation.</p>
<p>The audience received their written responses and could ask questions from them. The CSJ moderator and president, Dan Gilbarg, asked the trio to pose a question to each other and also pay each other a compliment.</p>
<p>Massie received a few chuckles when telling Gonzalez his tenacity makes him “keep upping my game,” and complimented Warren’s sense of humor.</p>
<p>All three gave similar responses to whether they supported Baker’s revised two-part plan for South Coast Rail to include an initial stage through Middleboro and the completed route through Stoughton nearly a decade later.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in the Middleboro plan,” Warren said. He advocated greater efforts toward a regional transportation system.</p>
<p>“I believe Phase II will never happen under his plan,” Gonzalez said. “The Stoughton route is the right way to go.”</p>
<p>“I also support the Stoughton route,” Massie said. “The governor has not laid out a full plan.”</p>
<p>After the speaking program, Gilbarg asked the candidates to leave the room while he conducted an informal straw poll of whom they thought responded best. By a show of hands, Massie received the most votes with 22, followed by Gonzalez with 13 and Warren with 10.</p>
<p>A few people in the audience answered a reporter’s question on whom they supported afterward.</p>
<p>Carl Rodrigues, a retired production supervisor from Fall River, said he backed Massie because he found him the “most progressive.”</p>
<p>“I was disappointed,” Margaret Amaral, a small businesswoman from New Bedford said of the vote. “Setti Warren has impressed me from the beginning. He’s got my vote.”</p>
<p>Ana Bracero of New Bedford said she liked Warren because “he talked a lot more about solving issues.”</p>
<p>The Rev. James Hornsby of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in Fall River said, “I thought Jay Gonzalez gave terrific answers.”</p>
<p>Hornsby, like many in the audience, is a member of the CSJ, formed in 1994.</p>

<h6>April 11, 2018</h6>
<p>Democrat Setti Warren said last week that he was taking a principled stand against mandatory minimum sentences when he said he would veto a criminal justice reform bill backed unanimously by legislative Democrats, but that stand appears to be alienating the gubernatorial hopeful from some leaders in his own party.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was an uninformed statement,&#8221; Sen. William Brownsberger told the News Service on Tuesday about Warren&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>As Gov. Charlie Baker weighs whether to sign the sweeping criminal justice reform package now on his desk, Warren&#8217;s position has not only shed some light on how the former Newton mayor might govern, but also exposed one of the first real pressure points in the three-way Democratic primary for governor.</p>
<p>Warren&#8217;s primary opponents – former state budget chief Jay Gonzalez and environmentalist Robert Massie – both say they would sign the bill, even though they share Warren&#8217;s opposition to mandatory minimum sentences.</p>
<p>And the two lead negotiators of the compromise bill, which has become one of the signature achievements for Democrats this legislative session, said Warren&#8217;s position gave them pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;This bill repeals a number of mandatory minimums as well as doing a whole lot of other good, so you got to look at the bigger picture,&#8221; Brownsberger said. He added, &#8220;Following that statement, I endorsed Jay Gonzalez.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren said last Wednesday that despite agreeing with 99 percent of the bill&#8217;s objectives, if he were governor he would veto the legislation because it added a new three-and-a-half year minimum sentence for someone convicted of trafficking the deadly synthetic opioids fentanyl and carfentanil.</p>
<p>He also said that the new minimum sentence was included in the final bill &#8220;seemingly at Baker&#8217;s insistence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren and his campaign were clear after followup questioning that he would not return the bill to the Legislature with an amendment to strike the new mandatory minimum, even though that would be an option for a governor. A veto can be overriden by the Legislature with a two-thirds vote in each branch.</p>
<p>Rep. Claire Cronin, the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee with Brownsberger who also negotiated the final bill, said she agreed with Brownsberger&#8217;s assessment of Warren&#8217;s take on the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure he understands the process, that the governor can actually send the bill back with an amendment, and that would be concerning to me,&#8221; Cronin said of Warren.</p>
<p>Brownsberger also flatly denied that Baker played any role in pressuring the conference committee to include the new mandatory minimum fentanyl trafficking sentence, and said the governor was one of many voices in the process who advocated for tough fentanyl penalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;That came from a lot of directions,&#8221; Brownsberger said.</p>
<p>Warren has dug in on his veto position in gubernatorial forums since he issued his statement, according to some who have attended, and the topic has become a major point of debate for the three men in the field.</p>
<p>Gonzalez told the News Service he would sign the legislation, even though he has proposed eliminating all mandatory minimums, and then go to work to try to build upon the positive elements of the bill. He highlighted an expansion of court diversion programs and bail reforms that cut down on people being jailed because they can&#8217;t afford to pay a court fine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, I disagree with Setti on his approach to this,&#8221; Gonzalez said. &#8220;If that is Setti&#8217;s sole criteria, his objection to mandatory minimum sentences, vetoing the bill would have the opposite effect because there are more mandatories removed than added. So I don&#8217;t agree with the premise of his objection.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the new minimum sentence for fentanyl trafficking, the bill also does away with several mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, including first and second offenses for cocaine possession.</p>
<p>Gonzalez also said he wouldn&#8217;t try to amend the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to put the entire piece of legislation at risk by sending it back and asking for an amendment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Warren posted a video to his Facebook page last week of him explaining his decision to a group of students, and acknowledged that many legislators were &#8220;not happy with yours truly&#8221; and had called him to make that point clear.</p>
<p>But in a statement to the News Service on Tuesday, Warren said that had not dissuaded him from his position, nor did he need to be schooled on what his options would be should he become governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankful for the hard work that went into putting this bill together and I acknowledge there are many things great things in it,&#8221; Warren said. &#8220;I appreciate the lesson on legislative procedure, but I don&#8217;t need anyone to explain to me the process by which mandatory minimum sentences have destroyed communities of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren continued, &#8220;As people are trying to wrap their heads around this bill, I want them to understand where I stand. When I&#8217;m governor, we&#8217;ll work to eliminate all mandatory minimum sentence for non-violent drugs crimes, and I will not sign any bill that implements a new mandatory minimum law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massie, in a statement, said vetoing the bill would be a &#8220;well-intentioned mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of getting rid of everything good about this bill by vetoing it, the governor should sign the bill, immediately introduce legislation to end minimum mandatory sentences for non-violent offenses, and work with the legislature to pass it,&#8221; Massie said.</p>

<h6>April 6, 2018</h6>
<p>The union of bus drivers at the Worcester Regional Transit Authority and the Funding for Public Transit Committee endorsed Setti Warren for governor Friday, saying the Newton Democrat was a strong ally as they fight proposed service cuts due to level funding in the governor’s budget.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to go with the guy we think will be the most outspoken about this,” said Justin Lawson, a member of the Funding For Public Transit Committee and a bus driver at the WRTA. “And someone who wants to not just to get the $88 million funding but will fight to expand service.”</p>
<p>Since 2014, the state’s 15 RTAs have expected $2 million increases in funding each year &#8211; to go from $80 million in 2015 to $88 million in 2019. Transit agencies, however, were level-funded at $82 million in 2016 and 2017, and received $80.4 million for the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>Faced with a nearly $1 million shortfall, the WRTA cut service, and raised fares for the first time since 2009, to balance its budget for the current cycle.</p>
<p>But the governor’s 2019 budget level-funds transit authorities as officials say costs for fuel, health insurance and contracts have gone up. As a result, the WRTA faces a $900,000 shortfall for the next year and has proposed service cuts ranging from reducing service on certain lines by half to eliminating weekend service.</p>
<p>Amalgamated Transit Union Local 22 and the Funding For Public Transit Committee, a group of union members lobbying legislators for the full RTA funding, hosted Mr. Warren Friday for a tour of the WRTA Maintenance and Operations Center, a meet and greet with passengers at the WRTA Hub on Foster Street, and a small gathering at the NU Cafe on Chandler Street.</p>
<p>“I am really honored to be standing here with you all, the WRTA, and receive your endorsement,” Mr. Warren said before launching into a speech where he outlined transportation, education and opioid epidemic needs facing the commonwealth.</p>
<p>“It is backward not to fully fund the RTA and it’s also backward not to expand it,” said Mr. Warren. “We can no longer afford to embrace the status quo and low expectations of this governor, Charlie Baker, and Beacon Hill.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>By Setti Warren</h6>
<h6>April 5, 2018</h6>
<p>Yesterday was the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination. It’s got me thinking about about my parents.</p>
<p>After my dad came home from the Korea, he and my mother went down to North Carolina so they could go to school. As young as they were, they both threw themselves into the Civil Rights Movement. They sat at lunch counters, risking violence and suffering all kinds of verbal abuse. My dad got arrested more than once.</p>
<p>They did it all in the hope that the next generation would inherit a world that was a little more fair and a little more just. At this moment in our country’s history, that generational obligation weighs heavily on me because of my family’s history.</p>
<p>I often ask myself, what am I doing every day to not be afraid–to say what’s right and to not back away from my principles. Yesterday was one of those days.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, both houses of the Massachusetts legislature passed a criminal justice reform bill. Nearly all of the bill is excellent and some great advocates and good Democrats worked very hard on it for a long time.</p>
<p>I had to tell my friends in the legislature, many of whom I admire greatly, that I would have vetoed their bill if I were governor. I could not in good conscience sign any bill that creates new mandatory minimum sentences. They are discriminatory, ineffective, and lead to mass incarceration.</p>
<p>The criminal justice reform bill passed by the legislature includes new mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent opioid related offenses, even though the bill also repeals other such sentences for non-violent drug convictions. These new mandatory minimums were part of a proposal put forth last summer by Gov. Charlie Baker.</p>
<p>The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis, but Gov. Baker is still approaching it like a criminal justice issue. If we learned anything from the failed ‘war on drugs’ mentality of the 1980’s and 90’s, it’s that harsh sentencing laws that take away judges’ discretion can destroy communities and do absolutely nothing to curb addiction.</p>
<p>If we are finally starting to recognize that mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug crimes should be repealed, why on earth would we want create a new law that we know will have the same effect?</p>
<p>I know many of my friends on Beacon Hill are upset by my position, but I’ve seen what misguided policies like mandatory minimums have done to communities, particularly communities of color–and I just can’t look the other way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settiwarren/videos/10156051438326224/">Please, take a moment to watch and share this video. It’s about my family and my reasons for making this decision.</a></p>

<h6>March 28, 2018</h6>
<p>Democratic gubernatorial candidates Jay Gonzalez, Bob Massie, and Setti Warren participated in a forum at Northampton High School Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The event, which was moderated by former Northampton Mayor Claire Higgins, saw around two hundred people pack into the school&#8217;s auditorium to hear the candidates speak. The forum was co-sponsored by the Democratic city and town committees of Amherst, Easthampton, Holyoke, Northampton, South Hadley, and Southampton.</p>
<p>Candidates answered questions from a panel made up of local journalists and academics, and also answered questions that had been submitted from several local non-profits and members of the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;The jobs in this state suck,&#8221; said Massie at one point, going on to decry the state of opportunity for young people across Massachusetts. Much of the evening&#8217;s discussions were in that spirit, and centered around struggling middle class families, income inequality, the opioid crisis, the poor state of public transportation and current Gov. Charlie Baker&#8217;s failure to properly mitigate any of these problems for everyday people.</p>
<p>Massie, who has worked as an activist and founder for numerous non-profits and organizations including the New Economy Coalition and Ceres, reiterated throughout the night that he felt Baker&#8217;s policies were literally bankrupting the state and the people in it.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, who formerly served as the Deputy Secretary of Administration and Finance in Gov. Deval Patrick&#8217;s administration, called Baker a &#8220;state quo, wait-and-see Governor,&#8221; and criticized him for not taking action where it was needed.</p>
<p>Democratic gubernatorial candidates address the issue of housing in Massachusetts<br />
Warren, who served two terms as the Mayor of the city of Newton, and held positions in campaigns for Bill Clinton and John Kerry, called income inequality the &#8220;defining issue of our time&#8221; and said he believed that the key to fixing the middle class was asking wealthier Massachusetts residents &#8220;to contribute more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren, who also formerly served as a naval intelligence specialist during the Iraq War and worked in the Clinton White House for several years, further stated he believed state revenue could be raised by closing tax loopholes for special interests.</p>
<p>With the issue of housing, all candidates agreed that something should be done to make sure that working families were not left behind or edged out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Massie advocated a consideration of rent control, remarking that housing could not be left up to markets because &#8220;markets build expensive housing for rich people, so you have to have the government step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gonzalez called the price of housing in Massachusetts a &#8220;crisis,&#8221; commenting &#8220;our economy is dependent on the fact that the work force can afford to live where they work, and we don&#8217;t have that right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Warren said that Massachusetts shouldn&#8217;t allow &#8220;developers to run the process&#8221; for housing. &#8220;We need to subsidize housing, folks,&#8221; he said, commenting that state and federal funding was necessary.</p>
<p>On the issue of sanctuary cities, all candidates were also in agreement: immigrants need to be protected.</p>
<p>Warren said that he supported immigrants and believed in sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said he supported immigrants, bringing up the current controversy in Springfield surrounding Mayor Domenic Sarno&#8217;s comments about a church providing sanctuary to an undocumented immigrant. Gonzalez called Sarno&#8217;s rhetoric &#8220;outrageous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massie said that he felt Massachusetts and the country should be welcoming to immigrants. &#8220;This is a nation built on immigrants,&#8221; he said, while also calling Trump a &#8220;vicious&#8221; and &#8220;cruel&#8221; President that didn&#8217;t understand America&#8217;s core values.</p>
